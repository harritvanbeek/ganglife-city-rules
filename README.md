Is totally allowed, during chases. In a chase both the criminal and police are allowed to use GTA driving

This is anything that can be considered an unrealistic situation.
This is usually common sense, simply ask yourself these questions: 
Does this happen In Real Life (IRL)?  or does this match your character's storyline
> For example
- A player who is kidnapped and continues to act as if nothing happened.
- Not roleplaying injuries, such as being shot multiple times and walking away.

9. **No Value Of Life**
All characters must have some level of fear for their lives. 
While your character may not truly die, they must act as if their character is subject 
to fear due to the possibility of being injured or losing their life. You must take into 
account all repercussions while your life is on the line, you can't be a hero every time.

```

10 **New Life Rule**
If your character gets hurt and dies/passes out, the moment they respawn after the 
timer ends they must forget everything that led up to that moment. 
This means you must roleplay it out that you lost your memory or forgot what 
happened and cannot return back to the scene for revenge. 
You should not be back to this particular scene within 15 minutes.
```ansi
[2;34mIf we notice this there is a warning about this, 
at the 3rd warning you have a day ban, with the 3rd ban you get a full ban![0m
```
Your character may only be allowed to survive and remember an injury which 
incapacitated them if an actual player (typically EMS) physically transports 
you to a hospital where you are treated and recover from you injuries
